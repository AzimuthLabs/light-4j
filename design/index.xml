      <description>While you are talking about microservices, chances are you existing application is built as web services. These days a lot of people and vendors are calling these web services as microservices and it is not right.
The following diagram shows what is the difference between web service and microservices.
As you can see the traditional web servers are flattened behind an API gateway and they are normally build on top of Java EE platform with JAXRS 1.</description>

      <description>light-4j is aiming microservices and design of microservices is more art other than technique. When you break a business application to smaller pieces, there is a threshold. If it too fine-grained, then the performance will suffer, but if it is too coarse-grained, then the benefit of microservices will be diminishing.
The big portion of design work for microservices is to functionally divide an application to multiple services and define the communication contract between these services with OpenAPI specifications.</description>
