      <description>Light-4J framework is the fastest so far on the market and there are a lot of effort to make that happen. There are a lot of frameworks, languages to build microservices but most popular ones are Java, Go and Nodejs.
Nodejs used to be really fast compare with JavaEE platforms but it has a lot of issues in enterprise world. Go has potentials but still not in enterprise applications. We are starting with Java due to the fact that it is highly optimized and there are so many existing investment in all sorts of organizations.</description>

      <description>When talking about microservices, a lot of Nodejs developers will say that Node is a better platform than Java and other languages to build microservices. The arguments are:
 Nodejs is faster than Java at runtime. Nodejs development is more productive than Java.  These claims are proved to be false already as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on both platforms in banking industry for the last couple of years. I have been building REST API frameworks on both Java and Nodejs and the following are my observations on Nodejs in enterprise computing.</description>
